Although playing in the mountains and sea every day was fun, I began to feel unsatisfied with the smallness of the town. What expanded my world was the Internet and computers. I encountered programming and learned the joy of giving shape to my ideas.",
    "middle.text2": "One day, I heard about the ICT education gap in South Africa from a friend who was studying there. Due to a lack of teaching materials, electricity, and teacher training, many children are deprived of learning opportunities. Touching on that reality, just as ICT changed my life, I wanted to deliver that power this time. Together with like-minded friends, I launched the student organization \"Ubunture.\"",
    "middle.text3": "I think this way. Many wars and conflicts arise from \"not knowing the other's world.\" The power to know people and the world is essential for living. And that is inherently fun. Especially in difficult times, I want to deliver the power to expand the world through ICT to the next generation without withdrawing into my own world.

    "representative.title": "Message from the Representative",
    "representative.heading": "Philosophy of Ubuntu",
    "representative.text1": "The origin of our activities lies in the Zulu teaching \"Ubuntu,\" which is also crowned in our organization's name. Ubuntu is the idea of acknowledging each other's existence and living together while supporting each other. Based on this philosophy, we have wished to create a world where children can learn what they like and freely envision their future. This activity was born while asking ourselves what we can do for that purpose.",
    "representative.text2": "The main stage of our activities is South Africa, located on the other side of the globe from Tokyo. The historical influence of apartheid is still strong, and inequality is said to be serious globally. Under these circumstances, we focused on ICT education, which can lead to future employment and income. ICT education has high costs for equipment and guidance systems, and differences between individuals, families, schools, and regions are likely to appear. From the awareness that the lack of educational opportunities narrows future options and can lead to the reproduction of inequality, we worked on implementing Unplugged ICT education that can foster logical thinking even without electricity or PCs.",
    "representative.text3": "However, at the same time, as we went to the site, conducted classes, and observed the current situation, we faced a reality that could not be captured by statistics and existing discussions alone. While we understood the magnitude of inequality as statistics, there was a reality that was difficult to grasp simply, where race, economy, urban structure, history, law, politics, and thought were intricately intertwined, and further constantly reorganized by discourse and media. What I first felt was not shock, but rather a sense of \"not understanding.\" Through the visit, rather than \"understanding becoming clear,\" complexity increased, and there were scenes that were sometimes painful to face directly.",
    "representative.text4": "Nevertheless, we want to continue watching what is happening there and learn and discover the logic behind it. To avoid misunderstanding, it might be close to a kind of \"interest.\" I think we find intellectual stimulation in the sensation of tracing the path hidden in complexity and connecting dots little by little.",
    "representative.text5": "However, we want to think seriously about what we can do for the children and society we touched, rather than just ending with understanding. Through this year's activities, the outline where \"what we can do\" and \"what we should do\" overlap has gradually become visible. It was also an activity to return to Ubuntu, the origin, and carefully reconnect the relationship of mutual support. What we did, what we couldn't do, what we saw, what we didn't understand, what we felt, and what we are thinking. And now, what we are aiming for. I would be happy if I could convey much of that through this report.",
    "representative.text6": "Finally, this year's activities were realized with the support of many people, including Club of Fat Dig, SHIMOKITA COLLEGE, our main activity base, Professor Sakamoto of the University of Tokyo and other academics, and those active in the field of international education cooperation. In addition, the activities took shape thanks to the members involved in class implementation and material development locally, and the power of many students who acted together. I would like to express my deepest gratitude here. We look forward to your continued guidance and support.",

    "what-do.text1": "In December 2025, we traveled to Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa, to conduct educational support activities at local educational institutions, Molo Mhlaba School and Kliptown Youth Program. This project intervened using the 'Unplugged ICT Education' method, which allows students to master basic concepts of information science even in places without PCs or internet environments, addressing the digital divide caused by income disparity and lack of infrastructure. Student members from the University of Tokyo and SHIMOKITA COLLEGE served as instructors and verified a sustainable learning model based on local constraints.",
    "what-do.text2": "The curriculum provided was designed to foster the five abilities of Computational Thinking: algorithmic thinking, decomposition, generalization, abstraction, and evaluation. Specific class contents included workshops where humans acted as robots to execute command procedures, pixel art to learn conversion rules between images and numerical data, learning calculation algorithms using Japanese abacuses, and experiments creating structures using only paper for simulation. In the final stage of the program, we used the educational robot mBot and smartphones to conduct practical training connecting the learned logical thinking to actual programming operations and sensor control.",
    "what-do.text3": "As a measure of the activity's effectiveness, we collected quantitative data through pre- and post-descriptive tests and questionnaires for participating children. In parallel with educational practices, we met with researchers from Stellenbosch University and the University of Pretoria to discuss structural factors of educational disparity and future cooperation systems, and conducted field surveys of living environments and infrastructure in townships. Through these activities, we plan to build an educational cooperation model that can be continuously operated by local university students, going beyond one-off support from the outside.",

    "modal.unplugged_title": "Unplugged ICT Education",
    "modal.unplugged_desc": "We conducted workshops to learn basic concepts of information science without using electronic devices so that they can be acquired even in environments with insufficient computer and internet facilities. Specifically, we aimed to foster the five abilities of Computational Thinking (CT), such as algorithmic thinking, decomposition, and abstraction, through games where humans act as robots executing commands, digital data conversion experiences using pixel art, and structural experiments building high towers using only paper. The teaching materials were designed to be understood across language barriers by using visual illustrations and physical activities, and quantitative evaluation was also performed using pre- and post-tests to measure learning effects.",
    "modal.teacher_title": "Teacher Training",
    "modal.teacher_desc": "Although we did not conduct specific training programs for local teachers during this trip, through field surveys and interviews with experts, the lack of instructors and skills was recognized as a clear issue and one of the biggest barriers to promoting ICT education. In dialogue with Professor Jansen of Stellenbosch University, the challenges of public education in South Africa were discussed in comparison with cases of teacher training dissemination in neighboring countries. Based on this current situation, as a future prospect, we aim to shift from a format where Japanese students conduct classes alone to a system where we develop and operate programs jointly with local university students and educators, allowing the local side to continue education autonomously.",
    "modal.exchange_title": "International Exchange",
    "modal.exchange_desc": "We incorporated 'Cultural Exchange' into the class curriculum and conducted activities that fused cultural experience with learning logical thinking. Specifically, we performed the Japanese 'Soran Bushi' and the local dance music 'Amapiano', understanding their choreography as the concept of 'conditional branching' in programming. Also, outside of class, members interacted with local children during lunch and break times, touching on each other's cultures and backgrounds, providing an opportunity for equal mutual understanding beyond the relationship of supporter and supported.",

    "representative.text2": "主な活動の舞台は、東京から見て地球の裏側に位置する南アフリカです。アパルトヘイトの歴史的影響は現在も色濃く、格差は世界的にも深刻だと言われています。こうした状況のなかで私たちは、将来の就労や所得にもつながり得る ICT 教育に焦点を当てました。ICT 教育は設備や指導体制などのコストが高く、個人・家庭・学校・地域間の差が表れやすい領域です。教育機会の欠如がその後の選択肢を狭め、格差の再生産につながり得るという課題意識から、電気や PC がなくても論理的思考を育める Unplugged ICT 教育の実施に取り組みました。",
    "representative.text3": "しかし同時に、私たちは現地に赴き、授業を実施したり、現状を観察したりする中で、統計や既存の議論だけでは捉えきれない現実にも直面しました。格差の大きさは統計として理解していた一方、人種・経済・都市構造・歴史・法律・政治・思想が複雑に絡み合い、さらに言説やメディアによって絶えず再編成されていく、簡単には捉えきれない現実がそこにはありました。私がまず抱いたのは衝撃ではなく、恥ずかしながら「分からないという感覚でした。渡航によって「理解が澄み切ったというより、むしろ複雑さが増し、時に直視するのがつらい場面もありました。",
    "representative.text4": "それでも私たちは、そこで起きていることを見続け、その背後にある論理を学びたい・発見したいと考えています。誤解のないように言えば、それはある種の「おもしろさ に近いのかもしれません。複雑さの中に潜む筋道を辿り、点と点が少しずつつながっていく感覚に、知的な刺激を見出しているのだと思います。",
